### 1. Inefficient Data Fetching Patterns
- **Location**: `frontend/src/app/quotes/page.tsx`
  - Multiple unnecessary API calls on component mount
  - No data caching implementation
  - Missing loading states
  - Impact: Poor performance and user experience

### 4. State Management Optimization
- **Location**: `frontend/src/context/QuoteContext.tsx`
  - Context updates causing unnecessary re-renders
  - Missing state persistence
  - Impact: Poor performance and state management

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Implement proper type checking and null safety
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Secure sensitive configuration
   - Implement proper transaction management

2. **Short-term Improvements**
   - Optimize React components for performance
   - Add proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
   - Add input validation

3. **Long-term Goals**
   - Refactor code for better organization
   - Improve test coverage
   - Implement monitoring and logging

## Potential Future Problems

1. **Scalability Issues**
   - Current architecture may not handle increased load
   - Database queries need optimization
   - Missing caching strategy

2. **Maintenance Challenges**
   - Technical debt in payment processing
   - Complex state management
   - Difficult to test components
